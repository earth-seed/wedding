              consider making a donation to a charity supporting Palestinians

             Our commitment for Palestinian liberation is a pillar of our relationship and we hope you'll join us in supporting this cause.
             We are against the occupation of Palestine and the existence of the apartheid state of Israel.
             We would like to only have guests at our wedding who are aligned with us on these principles.
